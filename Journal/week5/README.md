✨What I learned this week✨

This week, I finally learned how to install and run the XR Interaction Toolkit Simulator in Unity. With guidance from the tutorial and support from my tutor, I managed to follow the setup steps and understood how to test interactions even without wearing a real headset. In addition, I completed most of my Prototype 1, which focuses on creating a sticky note interaction system. I learned how to implement grabbable objects, show/hide virtual keyboards, and update text based on user input.

To achieve this, I actively explored Unity’s input system, wrote C# scripts for object behaviors, and referenced lots of YouTube tutorials. I also asked a friend for help when I got stuck, especially with script logic and prefab structure.

✨Reflection✨

One key mistake I made this week was following an outdated tutorial that used Oculus XR Plugin instead of OpenXR, which caused my simulator to stop working. After spending hours trying to troubleshoot why the simulator wasn’t responding, I realised that the plugin choice actually affects whether the simulator is compatible. This mistake helped me better understand the differences between XR SDKs, and the importance of choosing the right base setup depending on testing needs.

Although it was frustrating to rebuild my scene after changing the SDK, I now feel much more confident about setting up XR environments from scratch. I also realised that learning through doing—trial and error, debugging, and video searching—is a very effective way for me to grow my technical confidence.

✨Next steps✨

Next week, I will focus on:
Testing whether my interaction flow (grab > type > place) works smoothly across different distances and user positions.

Preparing for user testing, including a short interview script and bug log.

Iterating on design improvements based on both technical usability and feedback from my peers.

I’ll also try to optimise how the sticky notes refresh after being used, so the user can always access a new one without needing to manually reset the scene.
